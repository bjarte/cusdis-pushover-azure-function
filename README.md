# cusdis-pushover-azure-function
Minimal Azure function to send messages from Cusdis to Pushover

_Cusdis_ is the commenting system I use on my websites, hvemder.no and basementmedi.no.

Cusdis has the option to send a request to a webhook every time someone adds a comment.

_Pushover_ is a webservice and an Android/iPhone app that lets you push notifications to a user with the app installed.
